</p><span class='header' id='Introduction'></span><h2> Introduction</h2>

<p>Dimension reduction is an important problem in data science and, more
generally, function approximation. Consider a multivariable function
\(f : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow (S, d)\) where \((S,d)\) denotes a metric
space with metric \(d\). In the context of data science, \((S,d)\) could
represent a discrete classification space, a continuous real-valued
space, or could be descriptive of some graph structure. In this paper,
the supervised learning problem is considered, where a finite set \(X
\subset \mathbb{R}^d\) of data points are given along with labeled
function values \(Y = \{y_i = f(x_i) | x_i \in X\}\).  There are many
algorithms in the field of data science, mathematics, and machine
learning for predicting such functions such as multivariate spline
approximations, neural networks, clustering algorithms, support vector
machines/regressors, and many more. One particularly common yet
effective class of solutions to these problems are distance based
approximations such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN).  Though effective for
many classes of problems, these methods depend on the premise that
distance in the input space can be associated with change in the
output class or value. While this assumption holds for most of the
common "big data" problems, it is often the case that some number of
directions in the input space have no bearing on the output
class/value. Without applying dimension reduction, these directions
will increase the cost of any distance based approximation techniques,
in some cases making the techniques computationally intractable.
Furthermore, such "meaningless directions" cannot improve prediction
accuracy, and often decrease accuracy by disassociating distance from
change in class/value.</p>

<p>In this paper, a novel technique for performing dimension reduction is
proposed that considers how the output \(f(x)\) changes given the data
\(X\) and function value/labels \(Y\). Using this information, an
orthonormal basis is constructed for a new subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^d\)
where every direction is associated with some change in \(f\), thereby
increasing the accuracy of distance based methods while often
significantly reducing the dimension. The technique is model agnostic,
meaning that it can be applied as a "pre-conditioning" step before any
distance based approximation. The effectiveness of the technique is
demonstrated on one theoretical and three real-world functions, using
four different distance based approximation algorithms and a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP).</p>
<span class='header' id='Background'></span><h2> Background</h2>
<span class='header' id='Related Work'></span><h3> Related Work</h3>

<p>One of the most standard methods for performing dimension reduction is
correlation analysis, whereby a general model<dt-fn>The model may be a
multivariable linear or quadratic model, possibly with interaction
terms.</dt-fn> is fit<dt-fn>Most commonly fits are performed via least-squares
approximation.</dt-fn> to the data and the coefficients of each term are
analyzed to determine whether that term has any effect on the
output. After dropping all terms that have no statistically
significant effect on the function value, it can be inferred that only
the directions associated with the remaining terms affect the output
class or function value. These techniques are highly effective when an
appropriate model is chosen, but are highly model dependent and
generally fail for a black-box output function \(f\). For example, this
technique is most commonly applied by fitting a linear model to
labeled data. Then, if the function \(f\) is not itself approximately
linear, the above technique can fail to produce any meaningful
results.</p>

<p>Principle component analysis (PCA) is another commonly used as a
dimension reduction technique. An explanation of Principle Component
Analysis and its applications can be found in
<dt-cite key="PCAtutorial,powell_lehe_2014"></dt-cite>. Given a finite set of unlabeled
points \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^d\), PCA identifies an ordered set of
orthonormal basis vectors \(\{v_1, \ldots, v_d\},\) such that the
projection of \(X\) onto any subspace defined by the span of \(\{v_1,
\ldots, v_k\},\) \(k \leq d\) has maximal variance. Equivalently, PCA is
the dimension reduction technique that minimizes reconstruction error
for \(X\) with respect to mean squared error (MSE). In its standard
application, PCA is an unsupervised technique, and does not consider
the effect of each dimension on output class or function values.</p>

<p>Recently a modified variant of PCA was proposed which incorporates
function values into the subspace basis and the technique is referred
to as <i>supervised PCA</i> <dt-cite key="barshan2011supervised"></dt-cite>. However this
technique relies on the coefficients of a linear fit and faces the
same nonlinear approximation weaknesses (as will be demonstrated in a
theoretical example).</p>

<p>Other notable techniques include linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
and neural network autoencoders. LDA depends heavily on linear
separability of the output classes, and therefore can fail for a
general function \(f\). In their most naive implementation,
autoencoders are equivalent to standard PCA. However, they can be
modified to also consider output labels, though no convergence
guarantees can be made and the results are purely heuristic. Other
feature weighting techniques have been studied for clustering and
generic learning algorithms
<dt-cite key="FeatureWeightingForClustering,FeatureWeightingReview"></dt-cite>, and in
general a lot of work has been done on feature selection given a model
<dt-cite key="FeatureSurvey,tenenbaum2000global"></dt-cite>. Those survey papers
extensively cover existing techniques and approaches for weighting
(continuous valued) and selecting (binary operation) features of data
for making accurate approximations.</p>
<span class='header' id='Approximation Techniques'></span><h3> Approximation Techniques</h3>

<p>Four distance based approximation techniques are used to validate the
proposed dimension reduction technique and additionally a classic
neural network is tested. The first approximation algorithm is
k-nearest neighbor using the 2-norm distance with \(k=1,\) and the
second is the same method with \(k=10.\) By sorting points in a tree,
k-nearest neighbors is able to scale linearly with the input dimension
and near logarithmically with respect to number of input points. The
second technique is the modified linear Shepard's method called LSHEP
<dt-cite key="thacker2010algorithm"></dt-cite>. LSHEP incorporates a local linear fit into
the the original Shepard's method <dt-cite key="shepard1968two"></dt-cite>, an inverse
distance weighting technique that scales linearly with dimension and
linearly with number of points. The final distance based technique
uses the Delaunay triangulation, a piecewise linear interpolant based
on a simplicial mesh of the same name <dt-cite key="chang2018polynomial"></dt-cite>. Of the
above techniques, Delaunay is the most computationally expensive,
scaling approximately linearly with number of points, but growing
prohibitively expensive in dimension greater than 50. The last
technique for general comparison is a classic neural network called a
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This work uses the implementation
available at <dt-cite key="scikit-learn"></dt-cite> while choosing the Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) activation function and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) error
minimizer. 1000 gradient steps are allowed to be taken and the
default number of hidden nodes (100) is used with one hidden layer.</p>
<span class='header' id='Methodology'></span><h2> Methodology</h2>

<p>A a novel application of Principle Component Analysis is proposed in
order to perform dimension reduction in a supervised learning
context. The method will be referred to as Metric PCA (MPCA).</p>

<p>Let \(f : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow (S,d)\) be an arbitrary function of
interest, where \((S,d)\) is a metric space.
Let \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) be a finite set of points with known
function values (labels) \(Y = \{y_i = f(x_i) | x_i \in X\}\).</p>

<p>Consider the set \(Z\) of vectors</p>

<p>
$$ Z = \bigg\{ \frac{(x_i - x_j)\  d(y_i, y_j)}{\|(x_i - x_j)\|_2^2} : \quad x_i, x_j \in X, \quad y_i, y_j \in Y, \bigg\}$$</p>

<p>with covariance matrix \(Cov(Z).\) Note that since \(Cov(Z)\) is
symmetric, its Eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis for
\(\mathbb{R}^d\). Note that if the original set \(X\) contains
\(n\) points, then the new set \(Z\) must contain \(\sim n^2\)
points, since it consists of all vectors <i>between</i> points in \(X\),
rescaled by change in their corresponding function values (in \(Y\)).</p>

<p>An Eigenvector decomposition is performed on \(Cov(Z),\) then reduce to
the lower-dimensional space spanned by its first \(k\) Eigenvectors,
ranked by the magnitude of their corresponding Eigenvalues (i.e., PCA
on the new set \(Z\)). A <i>magnitude</i> is assigned to each vector by
computing the <i>total variation</i> of the function along each Eigenvector
and normalizing the sum of magnitudes to be one. In practice, instead
of performing an Eigenvector decomposition on \(Cov(Z),\) a singular
value decomposition is performed on the matrix \(\displaystyle
Z^\star\), whose rows are transposed vectors in \(Z\). Then, \(Z^\star = U
\Sigma V^T\), and the columns of \(V\) are exactly the Eigenvectors of
\(Cov(Z).\)</p>
<span class='header' id='Equivalence of PCA and MPCA Under Distance Metric'></span><h3> Equivalence of PCA and MPCA Under Distance Metric</h3>

<p>In this section it is shown that in the special case where \(d(y_i,y_j)
= \|x_i - x_j\|_2\), MPCA is identical to PCA.</p>

<p>Given \(X\) as stated above, if the set of all pairwise difference
vectors \(Z\) is considered, then \(PCA(Z) = PCA(X).\) Denote \(Z_j\) to be
the subset of \(Z\) about vertex \(x_j \in X,\) \(Z_j = \{x_j - x_i : x_i
\in X\}.\)</p>

<p>This conclusion is achieved by considering the first principle
component of \(X,\) \(v_1 \in \mathbb{R}^d.\) It is noted that the first
principle component of \(Z\) is the same.</p>

<p><p style='padding-left: 60px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>
$$\begin{align}
      \max_{\|v\|_2 = 1} \|Zv\|_2 = &\max_{\|v\|_2 = 1} \|Zv\|_2^2 \\
      = &\max_{\|v\|_2 = 1} \textstyle{\sum_{z \in Z}} \langle z, v \rangle^2 \\
      = &\max_{\|v\|_2 = 1} \textstyle{\sum_{Z_j \subset Z} \sum_{z \in Z_j}} \langle z, v \rangle^2 \\
      \leq &\ \textstyle{\sum_{Z_j \subset Z} \max_{\|v\|_2 = 1} \sum_{z \in Z_j}} \langle z, v \rangle^2 \\
      = &\ \textstyle{\sum_{Z_j \subset Z} \sum_{z \in Z_j}} \langle z, v_1 \rangle^2 \\
      = &\ \textstyle{\sum_{z \in Z}} \langle z, v_1 \rangle^2 \\
      = &\ \|Zv_1\|_2^2 \\
      \\
      \implies\max_{\|v\|_2 = 1} \|Zv\|_2 &= \|Zv_1\|_2.
     \end{align}$$</p></p>

<p>After removing the first component from each vector in \(Z\), the same
technique can be reapplied to find the second component. This
methdology can be applied to the remaining components in an inductive
fashion, to show total equivalence of the principle components for \(X\)
and \(Z.\)</p>
<span class='header' id='Demonstration'></span><h3> Demonstration</h3>

<p>Consider the following example. In this, \(X^{(50\ \times\ 2)}\) is a
random sample of points drawn from the unit cube and the values come from a
function \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\) defined as \(f(x,y)
= x^2\) and note that this only depends on the \(x\) direction. On the
right the set \(Z\) can be seen with the computed (and scaled) principle
components.</p>

<p><iframe src='https://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/files/[2018-11-28]_mpca_demo_2.html' frameBorder='0' style='height: 420px; width: 510px;'></iframe></p>

<p>
The above plot displays a characteristic example of a set of points
that are not distributed according the direction of greatest change in
the underlying function. This causes PCA to produce distinctly
different vectors from MPCA, noting that the standard principle
components are not even ordered correctly in terms of importance. The
symmetric underlying function would also cause <i>supervised PCA</i> to
fail on this problem as well, since no meaningful linear fit can be
produced.</p>
<span class='header' id='Evaluation'></span><h3> Evaluation</h3>

<p>To further evaluate the performance of MPCA, it is applied on three
real-world problems. Specifically, MPCA is applied on two image
classification problems and one regression problem (Yelp rating
prediction). First, the performance of four common approximation
algorithms applied to the raw training data is evaluated using
four-fold cross validation. Then, the dimension is reduced to various
percentages of the total dimension using both MPCA and PCA and the
performance of each algorithm is reevaluated. Recall that when \(X\)
contains \(n\) data points, the transformed set \(Z\) contains \(\sim n^2\)
points. Therefore, MPCA requires the singular value decomposition of a
matrix \(\displaystyle Z^\star\) with \(d\) columns and \(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\)
rows.  Since this is not computationally feasible when \(n\) is large,
instead a random sample of some subset of vectors in \(Z\) is taken.</p>

<p>In particular, all combinations of the following are tested:</p>

<span class='header' id='Results'></span><h2> Results</h2>

<p><i> <b>Yelp</b> </i> <dt-cite key="yelp2018vegas"></dt-cite> is a collection of 479 American-style
restaurant ratings from Las Vegas. Most of the data is composed of
categorical descriptors, there are 63 features. This is a regression
problem, where the algorithm predicts the star rating of a restaurant
on 0-5 scale with .5 intervals.</p>

<p><i> <b>MNIST</b> </i> <dt-cite key="lecun_cortes_burges_2008"></dt-cite> is a collection 60,000
images that are randomly reduced to 10,000 black and white images,
each with shape [28 x 28] having 784 channels. The data poses a
classification problem with 10 unique classes, which are 10 digits
handwritten.</p>

<p><i> <b>CIFAR10</b> </i> <dt-cite key="krizhevsky2009learning"></dt-cite> is a collection of 50,000
images that are randomly reduced to 10,000 color images, each with
shape [32 x 32 x 3] having 3072 channels in total. The data poses a
classification problem with 10 unique classes that are common objects.</p>

<p>Following are the first 12 vectors obtained by metric principle
components analysis on the MNIST data.</p>

<p><p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'><img src='https://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/files/[2018-11-28]_MNIST_12_MPCA_Components.png' width='90%' style='margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px; display: inline-block;'></p></p>

<p>Notice how the first components are drastically different even though

<p>Notice that the empirical results demonstrate that MPCA is not
guaranteed to be the best reduction technique even for strictly
distance based prediction techniques. On the <i>Yelp</i> data, PCA still
produces better results for 10-nearest neighbors. We suspect this is
due to the reduction on \(Z\) and the increased variability introduced
by the metric scaling.</p>

<p>We do not consider these results exhaustive, nor do we devalue MPCA
accordingly. In almost all cases the differences between the best PCA
and MPCA predictors are less than \(1\%.\)</p>
<span class='header' id='Discussion'></span><h2> Discussion</h2>

<p>The error results for reduced-dimension problems using PCA and Metric
PCA (MPCA) are remarkably similar. In almost all cases the MPCA
reduction causes an improvement in prediction accuracy for nearest
neighbor predictions, though the improvement is small. Although the
theoretical examples demonstrate the potentially large difference
between MPCA and PCA, in practice they appear to often be nearly
equivalent. One could speculate that this is a contrived phenomenon,
the only data that is kept in curated sets is data that represents a
phenomenon of interest. MPCA is constructed to disregard data that is
not useful, but for the data sets chosen in this work the underlying
data is already distributed according to the functions being modeled.</p>
<span class='header' id='Conclusion'></span><h2> Conclusion</h2>

<p>The proposed technique, Metric PCA, demonstrates strong potential as a
dimension reduction strategy for approximation problems. Analytically,
Metric PCA is not susceptible to adverse data conditions that may
cause PCA to disregard important dimensions for
approximation. Empirically, the results obtained by MPCA and PCA are
quite similar, suggesting that many curated data sets have the
property that data descriptor variance corresponds closely to variance
in the underlying function. Analytic and empirical results combined
demonstrate the effectiveness of MPCA as a robust dimension reduction
strategy for approximation.</p>
