% explanatory comments for creating a correct copyright notice:
% The format of the copyright notice is:
% confAcro-sympAcro, YYYY Month Dates, City, State, Country; ©YYYY Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)
% The notice variables are: confAcro (conference acronym), sympAcro (symposium acronym), YYYY (4
% digit year the conference was held), Month (full name of the month the conference was held), Dates
% (date range of the conference), City (the full name of the city where the conference was held), State
% (standard 2-letter US postal abbreviation of the State where the conference was held) and Country
% (the standard international abbreviation of the name of the country where the conference was
% held). If the conference was held outside of the US, replace State with the appropriate value for the
% country where the conference was held. Replace all variables in both lines of the sample copyright
% notice with the appropriate values for your conference & symposium. Copyright will be held by SCS.
% Accepted work-in-progress and papers will be distributed in the Conference Publications. They will
% also be placed in the ACM Digital Library, as well as other prominent digital libraries, where they will
% remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.
