\caption{Finding a physical embedding: this figure shows a toy 32 qubit system demonstrating the Chimera graph structure (left) and a synthesized dense network on an individual unit cell (right). The Chimera graph consists of bipartite 8-qubit unit cells as shown, with sparse connections between cells.
To synthesize a dense 4-qubit network on any individual unit cell, negative coupler weights (shown in bold) are added.
I.e., $J_{0,4} = J_{1,5} = J_{2,6} = J_{3,7} < 0$.
