\heading{4. COMPLEXITY AND SENSITIVITY}
Algorithms 1, 2, and 4 have ${\cal O}(1)$ runtime. Given a fixed
schedule for shrinking derivative values, Algorithm 3 has a ${\cal
  O}(n)$ runtime for $n$ data points. In execution, the majority of
the time, still ${\cal O}(n)$, is spent solving the banded linear
system of equations for the B-spline coefficients. Thus for $n$ data
points, the overall execution time is ${\cal O}(n)$.

The quadratic facet model produces a unique sensitivity to input
perturbation, as small changes in input may cause different quadratic
facets to be associated with a breakpoint, and thus different initial
derivative estimates can be produced. This phenomenon is depicted in
Figure 1. Despite this sensitivity, the quadratic facet model is still
preferred because it exactly captures local linear and quadratic
behavior while empirically producing final approximations with less
wiggle ($L2$ norm of the second derivative) than other methods. A
weighted harmonic mean estimate of first derivatives may be more
accurate when the underlying function changes at a rate greater than a
quadratic, but that method increases the sensitivity to small
perturbations in data and empirically results in quintic splines with
greater wiggle.

The binary search for a point on the monotone boundary in $(\tau_1$,
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma)$ space is performed because it results in
monotone quintic spline interpolants with derivative values that are
absolutely nearer to initial estimates than a search that strictly
shrinks derivative values. Given the initial derivative estimates have
desirable properties (capture low-order phenomena and are low wiggle),
this search results in an approximation that is both monotone and has
derivative values similar to the initial estimates.

\narrower\noindent\rmVIII Fig.\ 1. A demonstration of the quadratic
  facet model's sensitivity to small data perturbations. This example is
  composed of two quadratic functions $f_1(x) = x^2$ over points $\{1$,
  $2$, $5/2\}$, and $f_2(x) = (x-2)^2 + 6$ over points $\{5/2$, $3$,
  $4\}$. Notably, $f_1(5/2) = f_2(5/2)$ and $f_1$, $f_2$ have the same
  curvature. Given the exact five data points seen above, the quadratic
  facet model produces the slope seen in the solid blue line at $x = 5/2$.
  However, by subtracting the value of $f_3$ $= \epsilon(x-2)^2$ from
  points at $x = 3$, 4, where $\epsilon$ is the machine precision
  ($2^{-52}$ for an IEEE 64-bit real), the quadratic facet model produces
  the slope seen in the dashed red line at $x = 5/2$. This is the nature
  of a facet model and a side effect of associating data with local facets.
