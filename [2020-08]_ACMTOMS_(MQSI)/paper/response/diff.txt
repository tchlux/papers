-an arbitrarily smooth monotone fit exists [Leitenstorfer and Tutz

-properties of quintic polynomials. The code by Fritsch [1982] for
-$C^1$ cubic spline interpolation is the predominantly utilized code

 The importance of piecewise quintic interpolation over lower order
 approximations can be simply observed. In general, the order of a

 {\it wiggle}) initial estimates of the first and second derivatives at
 the breakpoints while perfectly capturing local low-order phenomena

 quintic spline interpolants that are nearer to initial estimates than
 a policy that strictly shrinks derivative values.
