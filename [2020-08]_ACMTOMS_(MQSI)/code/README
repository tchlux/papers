         MQSI: Monotone Quintic Spline Interpolation

The package MQSI is a collection of Fortran 2003 routines for the
construction of a C^2 monotone quintic spline interpolant Q(X) to data
(X(I),F(X(I)), with the property that Q(X) is monotone increasing
(decreasing) over the same intervals [X(I), X(J)] as the data F(X(.))
is monotone increasing (decreasing). All routines use the module
REAL_PRECISION from HOMPACK90 (ACM TOMS Algorithm 777) for specifying
the real data type.

The physical organization into files is as follows.

 * The file 'REAL_PRECISION.f90' contains the module  REAL_PRECISION.

 * The file 'MQSI.f90' contains the subroutine MQSI, which computes a
   C^2 monotone quintic spline interpolant to data in terms of a
   B-spline basis, matching the monotonicity of the data.

 * The file 'SPLINE.f90' contains the subroutines FIT_SPLINE for
   constructing a B-spline basis representation of an osculatory
   spline Q(X) interpolating F(X), F'(X), ..., F^{(NCC-1)}(X) for NCC
   continuity conditions at each breakpoint X(K), and EVAL_SPLINE
   for computing the value, derivatives, and integral of Q(X).

 * The file 'EVAL_BSPLINE.f90' contains the subroutine EVAL_BSPLINE, a
   Fortran 2003 implementation of the B-spline recurrence relation
   evaluation code by C. deBoor for the value, derivatives, and
   integral of a B-spline.

 * The files 'blas.f' and 'lapack.f' contain just the necessary BLAS
   and LAPACK routines, in case the complete BLAS and LAPACK libraries
   are not available.

To compile and link, use the command:

 $F03 $OPTS REAL_PRECISION.f90 EVAL_BSPLINE.f90 SPLINE.f90 MQSI.f90 \
    $MAIN -o $EXEC_NAME $LIB

where '$F03' is the name of the Fortran 2003 compiler, '$OPTS' are
compiler options such as '-O3', '$MAIN' is the name of the main
program, '$EXEC_NAME' is the name of the executable, and '$LIB'
provides a flag to link BLAS and LAPACK. If the BLAS and LAPACK
libraries are not available on your system, then replace $LIB with the
filenames 'blas.f lapack.f'; these files contain the routines from the
BLAS and LAPACK libraries that are necessary for this package.

This package includes a sample main program in the file 'sample_main.f90'
illustrating the use of an input data file 'sample_main.dat', and an
extensive test suite in the file 'test_all.f90', all of which can be
compiled and linked as above.
