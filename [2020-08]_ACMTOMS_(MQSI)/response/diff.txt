ADDED REFERENCE TO MOLER AND HARMONIC MEAN ESTIMATES, MENTIONED LARGE
WIGGLE AS REASON FOR THE CHOICE OF QUADRATIC FACET MODEL.

+Fritsch and Carlson [1980] originally proposed the use of central     
+differences to estimate derivatives, however this often leads to extra
+and unnecessary {\it wiggles} in the spline when used to approximate  
+second derivatives. Modern shape-preserving spline implementations use
+a weighted harmonic mean to estimate derivative values at breakpoints 
+[Moler 2008], however this method also yields approximations whose    
+second derivative functions often have large $L^2$ norm (approximations
+with large {\it wiggle}). In an attempt to capture the local shape of 
+the data while minimizing wiggle, this package uses a facet model from
+image processing [Haralick and Watson 1981] to estimate first and     
+second derivatives at breakpoints. Rather than picking a local linear 
+or quadratic fit with minimal residual, this work uses a quadratic    
 facet model that selects the local quadratic interpolant with minimum
 magnitude curvature.

CHANGED THE WORDING IN THE ANALYSIS SECTION, BROKE UP PARAGRAPHS,
FOCUSED ON QUADRATIC FACET MODEL JUSTIFICATION, EXPANDED ON BINARY
SEARCH JUSTIFICATION.

 The quadratic facet model produces a unique sensitivity to input
 perturbation, as small changes in input may cause different quadratic
 facets to be associated with a breakpoint, and thus different initial
 derivative estimates can be produced. This phenomenon is depicted in
+Figure 1. Despite this sensitivity, the quadratic facet model is still
+preferred because it exactly captures local linear and quadratic
+behavior while empirically producing final approximations with less
+wiggle ($L^2$ norm of the second derivative) than other methods. A
+weighted harmonic mean estimate of first derivatives may be more
+accurate when the underlying function changes at a rate greater than a
+quadratic, but that method increases the second derivative sensitivity 
+to small perturbations in data and empirically results in quintic 
+splines with greater wiggle.
+
 The binary search for a point on the monotone boundary in $(\tau_1$,
 $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma)$ space is performed because it results in
 monotone quintic spline interpolants with derivative values that are
+absolutely nearer to initial estimates than a search that strictly
+shrinks derivative values. Given that the initial derivative estimates
+have desirable properties (capture low-order phenomena and are low 
+wiggle), this search results in an approximation that is both monotone
+and has derivative values similar to the initial estimates.
